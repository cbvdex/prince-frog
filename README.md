Android App for Personalized Dating Pattern Analysis

# Abstract
     For most people, it is hard to know from the start, what will be the personality quality of the other person as his/her future mate, that will well match his/her own. Most of the time, reality is so different from what they thought it would be. Everybody learns from “trials and error”. 
     There are many dating apps that help meet new people and there are also couple’s diary apps that help log anniversaries and texts, but not an app that helps “remind” of what was the collective lessons learned from own past experience.
     It is time to have a simple, fun, easy-to-use, private app that highlights personal experience, in a not overly complicated way, which frees the user from the burden to keep the train of thoughts of the lessons learned, for the use in the future.
